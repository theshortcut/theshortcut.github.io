      Clay is great to work with! He's a tremendously talented and proactive engineer who cares deeply about his work. One specific "shiny feature" of Clay is his ability to ask the right questions early on in the work-breakdown process, which frequently has directed attention to parts of a spec that may need to go back to the drawing board; this has really contributed to our ability to successfully execute a spec.

      Clay is a pleasure to work with. He is knowledgeable and hard working. I could always rely on Clay to get the job done and help with any problems I had. His code was consistently well written, and he always drove the business forward towards our goals. He was an excellent communicator, and helped make the team what it was. I'd love to work with him again.

      Clay is the secretest secret weapon in software development. He is incredibly connected to the pulse of new technology, and knows all about the latest devices, platforms, coding languages, and what is possible with the combination of all of them. He also has a great taste for music and entertainment in general, which obviously feeds his polished front-end design skills. I never questioned the integrity of the code Clay built, and any modifications were prompt and thorough (which is tricky to do). I have my fingers crossed that one day I get to work with Clay again.
